This mod adds an alternate layout for the areas on the schedule and animal tabs, so that when you have too many areas it looks much better.

It transitions to the alternate view at 10 areas by default, you can change the number in the mod settings.

This is intended to be used with Fluffy's Area Unlocker, which enables you to make more than 10 areas.
